    "In this first part of the project, you will solve a simple search-based problem on the Cachex game board.\n",
    "Before you read this specification, please make sure you have carefully read the entire ‘Rules for the Game\n",
    "of Cachex’ document. Although you won’t be writing an agent to play the game just yet, you should be\n",
    "aiming to get very familiar with the board layout and corresponding hex coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims for Project Part A are for you and your project partner to\n",
    "- refresh and extend your Python programming skills\n",
    "- explore some of the algorithms you have encountered in lectures, and \n",
    "- become more familiar with the Cachex task environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also a chance for you to develop fundamental Python tools for working with the game: Some of the functions and classes you create now may be helpful later (when you are building your full game-playing program for Part B of the project).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute this path you are asked to use an A* search and design an **admissible heuristic** to optimise its performance. There are a number of assumptions you should make:\n",
    "1. The start and goal cells will always be unoccupied (but any other cells may be occupied).\n",
    "2. All given cell coordinates will be within the bounds of a board of size n. More precisely, for any given cell coordinate (r, q), 0 ≤ r < n and 0 ≤ q < n. You may also assume n ≥ 1.\n",
    "3. The cost of a path is defined as the number of cells that form a continuous path from the start cell to the goal cell (including these cells).\n",
    "4. If there is a tie, that is, multiple minimal paths of the same cost exist on the same board configuration, any such path is a valid solution.\n",
