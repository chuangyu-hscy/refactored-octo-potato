# A* Path finding 

Under this file are materials help to understand the concept of A* algorithm. 

All codes in this folder are linked with this isse: https://github.com/chuangyu-hscy/refactored-octo-potato/issues/1

## Djistra

**Two assumptions**
1. the graph is finite
2. the edge cost are non-negative

The two assumptions ensure that Dijkstra always terminates and returns either the optimal path or a notification that no goal is reachable from the start state.

## A*

**Two assumptions**
1. the edges have strictly positive costs $\boldsymbol{\geq \varepsilon > 0}$
2. the state graph is finite, or a goal state is reachable from the start
