## Short summary about the A*

The goal of this algorithm is to find the shortest path from point A (start point) to point B (end point).

The main difference between Djistra and A* is we provide a heuristic function to guide the algorithm to the next best direction.

**Notations**
- Open Set => A priority queue which contains the items which we need to expand next

- G(n) => The current shortest distance from the start node to the current node
- H(n) => Heuristic function, distance of a node A to a node B using absolutely distance like eculidean or manhatten 
- F(n) => addition of G and H :: F(n) = G(n) + H(n)


## Djistra

**Two assumptions**
1. the graph is finite
2. the edge cost are non-negative

The two assumptions ensure that Dijkstra always terminates and returns either the optimal path or a notification that no goal is reachable from the start state.

## A*

**Two assumptions**
1. the edges have strictly positive costs $\boldsymbol{\geq \varepsilon > 0}$
2. the state graph is finite, or a goal state is reachable from the start
